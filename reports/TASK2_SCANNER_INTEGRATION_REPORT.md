# Task 2 Report: IaC/Infra Scanner Integration

## 1) Objective
- Integrate target security scanners into current pipeline architecture where technically possible.
- Separate:
  - fully integrated now
  - partially integrated now
  - later items requiring license/appliance/network prerequisites

## 2) Target Tool Matrix

### 2.1 IaC Scanning (target 4)
| Tool | Target Status | Current Integration | Blocking Requirement | Benefit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Snyk |  |  |  |  |
| Checkov |  |  |  |  |
| Terrascan |  |  |  |  |
| tfsec |  |  |  |  |

### 2.2 Infra Scanning (target 4)
| Tool | Target Status | Current Integration | Blocking Requirement | Benefit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nessus |  |  |  |  |
| Qualys (or equivalent cloud VM) |  |  |  |  |
| InsightVM |  |  |  |  |
| OpenVAS/Greenbone |  |  |  |  |

## 3) Implementation Details
- Workflow files changed:
- New scripts/config:
- Secrets/variables required:

## 4) Execution Result
- Test run IDs:
- Pass/fail summary:
- Artifact summary:

## 5) Practical Benefits in This Pipeline
- Shift-left IaC risk reduction:
- Cross-validation with runtime scan:
- Reduced false negatives/false positives:
- Better triage for auto-remediable vs manual controls:

## 6) Remaining Work (Later)
- Tool-by-tool prerequisite checklist:
- Required account/network/licensing steps:
- Planned rollout order:
